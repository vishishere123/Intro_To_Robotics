    "# Ultrasonic range sensor\n",
    "\n",
    "An ultrasonic range sensor is an electronic device which uses ultrasonic waves to measure distance. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are ultrasonic waves?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultrasonic waves are sound waves with frequency higher than that of audible frequency range. The frequency of audible sound waves range from 20 Hz to 20 kHz. Ultrasonic waves have a frequency higher than 20 kHz and therefore cannot be hear by humans. They are frequently used in devices like garage door opener, mobile phones. Since ultrasonic waves are sound waves (of higher frequency) they travel with the speed of sound.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Difference between IR sensor and Ultrasonic range sensor\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An IR sensor emits Infrared radiation which travels with the speed of light, while an ultrasonic sensor travels with the speed of the sound. Therefore, an IR sensor cannot be used for measuring distances but only for detecting obstacles. On the other hand, the Ultrasonic sensors can be used for measuring distances as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. An IR sensor has 3 pins namely, GND, VCC and VOUT. On the other hand, the ultrasonic sensor has 4 pins namely GND, VCC, Trigger and Echo. Therefore, in an IR sensor we cannot control when the infrared radiation will be emitted; the IR sensor emits the Infrared radiation automatically and continuously. On the other hand, the Trigger pin of the Ultrasonic sensor helps us to control when the ultrasonic waves will be emitted by the sensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Both the sensors need 5V of power on their VCC. The output of both the sensors are of 5V each and will need to be taken to an level shifter in order to be processed by the Pi.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm for Range Sensing Using Ultrasonic Range Sensor\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Trigger the UltraSonic output.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Wait for 0.000001 seconds\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Stop the output. Note the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Wait for the reflected waves to be received and echo pin to start giving input.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  As soon as the echo pin becomes active, note the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The time elapsed between steps 2 and steps 5 is the time taken by the wave to reach the obstacle, hit it and then return. Multiply it by 343/2 to obtain the distance between the sensor and the obstacle in meters.\n"
