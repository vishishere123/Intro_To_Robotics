    "\n",
    "A local area network (LAN) consists of computers connected together among themselves, without any connection to the outside.\n",
    "\n",
    "To form a LAN, you need two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Computers forming the network which have same IP addresses such as the network portion of the IP address are the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A Router.\n",
    "\n",
    "### IP Address:\n",
    "\n",
    "The IP Address is addresss (a number) assigned to the computer on a network. The IP address is assigned by the router. There are right now two (2) ways to write IP addresses , IPv4 and IPv6.\n",
    "\n",
    "An IPv4 address contains 4 numbers seperated among themselves by 3 decimals. Each of the numbers can vary between 0 and 255. Out of those 4 numbers, how many are assigned to indentifying the network (while the remaining are used to identifying the computer itself) is determined by its subnet mask.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Subnet mask = 255.255.0.0 \n",
    "This implies that  2 numbers (out of 4) are used for identifying the network, whilst 2 are used for identifying the computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Subnet mask = 255.0.0.0\n",
    "This implies that 1 number (out of 4) are used for identifying the network, whilst 3 are used for identifying the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Subnet mask = 255.255.255.0 \n",
    "This implies that 3 numbers (out of 4) are used for identifying the network, whilst 1 is used for identifying the computer."

    "\n",
